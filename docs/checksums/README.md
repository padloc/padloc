# Checksums

We use file checksums (SHA-256) to verify the source code you see matches the
code served by our app. These are instructions for you to verify that too, so
you don't have to trust us.

**NOTE:** These commands are meant for Linux and should also work on macOS. For
Windows systems, we suggest you run them via WSL2.

In here you can find ways to verify the checksums for the different platforms:
