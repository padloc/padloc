This package contains translations, word lists and various localization tools
for the Padloc app.

## How To Contribute

### Translations

One of the easiest ways to contribute to this project is to help create or
improve translations in your language. Translations are stored as simple
[JSON](https://www.json.org/) files in the following format:

```json
[
    [
        "Hello World", // Original text in English
        "Hallo Welt" // Translation
    ],
    [
        "{0} times {1} makes {2}", // Original text with placeholders
        "{0} mal {1} ergibt {2}" // Translation with placeholders
    ]
]
```

To add or update a translation for a given text, simply locate the translation
file for your language in the
[translations directory](packages/locale/res/translations/), find the text you
want to translate and insert your translation below. If no translation file for
you language exists yet, you can start from scratch, using
[this empty translations file](res/translations/_template.json).
Simply copy it and name it `xx.json`, replacing "xx" with the appropriate
lowercase
[country code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements).

### Word Lists

Word lists are used to generate random passphrases from a list of commonly used
words from a given language. You can find all existing word lists
[here](packages/locale/res/wordlists/).
